# ARCHIVED: Now maintained [here](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/Better-MIUI-Icons)
![banner](banner.png)

This module systemlessly installs more modern icons to /system/media/theme/miui_mod_icons.\
The icons will be shown in the app info screen, recent apps, and stock launcher.




Tested on:\
\
• Xiaomi.EU\
• RevOS\
• MMX\
• Global MIUI 12\
\
It should work on any MIUI 12-based ROM. MIUI 11-based ROMs might work, but is untested.


# Disclaimer
These icons were extracted from the MiRoom ROM project, which has unfortunately shut down.\
I have no affiliation with the Miroom team.
